# Emotional-Equilibrium

*This is the code from my YouTube Video*

With automation on the rise and the inevitability of Skynet, us humans need to unite and train to be better than the androids. What makes us different? That's right: our emotions. Fortunately for programmers, we don't experience such weakness but it's only fair if we share this ability with other human beings. This program does just that. 

Whenever you express an emotion, the program verbally manipulates you into feeling the opposite. For example, if you appear sad, the sophisticated program will compliment you. If you appear happy, the program will insult you and make you cry. Only then to compliment you. But don't smile, because then you'll be insulted... However, if you feel no emotion and express a neutral face, the program will finally shut up.

This program works using a Tensorflow CNN trained on facial expressions/emotions.
